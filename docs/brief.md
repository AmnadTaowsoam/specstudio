# SpecStudio Brief

## One-line summary

Turn product ideas into buildable specifications, acceptance criteria, and delivery-ready work packages.

## Product category

product specification studio

## Background

AI-assisted work is becoming normal inside engineering, product, operations, and go-to-market teams, but most teams still rely on scattered prompts, one-off scripts, informal checklists, and undocumented decisions. The result is speed without enough repeatability. SpecStudio should provide a focused product surface for one important workflow, with enough structure to support real delivery rather than a temporary demo.

## Problem statement

The target user needs to complete product specification studio work with confidence. Today they typically face:

- unclear input requirements before work starts
- inconsistent output quality between runs or team members
- weak traceability from source material to final decisions
- manual review steps that are not captured as evidence
- security and permission questions discovered too late
- no standard handoff format for engineering, operations, or stakeholders

## Target users

Primary users: founders, product managers, delivery leads, solo builders.

Secondary users:

- engineering managers who approve adoption
- security or compliance reviewers who need auditability
- implementation teams who turn product output into shipped systems
- operators who maintain the workflow after launch

## Core promise

SpecStudio helps users move from messy inputs to a reviewed, actionable output through a repeatable workflow. The product should feel practical, governed, and implementation-ready. It should not feel like a generic chatbot.

## Differentiation

- Opinionated workflow for product specification studio, not a blank prompt box.
- Built-in evidence capture and approval points.
- Clear separation between draft AI output and verified deliverables.
- Integration-ready design for real team tools.
- Requirements and delivery checkpoints included from the beginning.

## MVP scope

The MVP must include:

- workspace and project setup
- guided intake for the core workflow
- structured data model for inputs, runs, outputs, risks, and approvals
- AI-assisted generation or analysis step where it adds leverage
- manual review and revision controls
- export or handoff to common delivery formats
- audit log for important user, AI, and system actions
- basic admin settings for roles, integrations, and retention

The MVP should not include:

- marketplace features
- complex multi-tenant billing
- custom plugin SDK unless required by the core workflow
- enterprise SSO beyond a clean abstraction
- unlimited automation without review gates

## Key workflows

### 1. Create workspace

The user creates a workspace, names the project, chooses a template, and configures basic privacy settings.

### 2. Capture inputs

The user adds the source material needed for SpecStudio: text, files, repository links, API specs, workflow descriptions, test cases, or integration details depending on the use case.

### 3. Run guided analysis

The system validates inputs, identifies missing information, applies policy checks, and produces draft output with assumptions clearly separated from verified facts.

### 4. Review and approve

The user reviews the result, edits the output, resolves warnings, and records approval or rejection.

### 5. Deliver

The system exports the final package as Markdown, JSON, issue tickets, repository files, or integration-specific payloads.

## Success metrics

- time from intake to first useful output
- percentage of runs with all required inputs completed
- number of review warnings resolved before delivery
- user acceptance rate for generated drafts
- repeat usage by the same workspace within 30 days
- reduction in manual handoff clarification requests

## Positioning statement

For founders, product managers, delivery leads, solo builders, SpecStudio is a product specification studio that converts unstructured work into verified, handoff-ready outputs. Unlike generic AI assistants, it includes workflow state, review gates, audit trails, and implementation-focused documentation.
