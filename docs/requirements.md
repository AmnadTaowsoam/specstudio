# SpecStudio Requirements

## 1. Purpose

SpecStudio is a AI Workflow Document Studio that helps users produce practical, reviewable, and reusable outputs from a focused workflow. The product must be useful as a public repository while still being compatible with Cerebra MCP as an internal orchestration, review, testing, security, and DevOps layer.

## 2. Source Alignment

This requirements document is based on the project overview for the Cerebra public product set. Product definition:

- Name: SpecStudio
- Category: AI Workflow Document Studio
- Summary: Generate professional project documents before code begins: brief, requirements, architecture, stories, API spec, test plan, and deployment plan.
- Priority: Phase 2 / Top 5
- Cerebra MCP fit: CerebraOrchestrator-mcp, CerebraReview-mcp, CerebraTesting-mcp, CerebraDevops-mcp

## 3. Goals

- Provide a complete MVP path from input to usable output.
- Make SpecStudio understandable to public GitHub visitors without requiring private Cerebra context.
- Produce artifacts that developers, operators, or AI coding agents can immediately use.
- Include validation, review, risk reporting, and delivery evidence.
- Keep the first release focused enough to build and maintain.

## 4. Non-goals

- Do not build a generic chatbot as the primary product.
- Do not require users to run the full Cerebra MCP platform to understand the repo.
- Do not hide assumptions, missing inputs, or risk warnings.
- Do not perform destructive, paid, or outward-facing actions without explicit confirmation.
- Do not expand into marketplace, billing, or enterprise administration before MVP value is proven.

## 5. Personas

### Primary Builder

The person who runs SpecStudio to create or inspect the target artifact. They need clear setup, fast feedback, and usable output.

### Technical Reviewer

The person who evaluates output quality, security, maintainability, and delivery readiness. They need evidence, findings, and clear risk levels.

### Project Owner

The person deciding whether the product is worth adopting or extending. They need a readable README, credible scope, sample output, and a realistic roadmap.

## 6. Inputs

The product must accept these input categories:

- project goal, audience, features, constraints, stack, deployment target, examples, non-goals
- project metadata: name, owner, tags, target environment
- optional constraints: technology stack, compliance needs, deployment target
- optional examples: sample files, sample repo, sample API, sample workflow, sample prompt, or sample document depending on project type

Required inputs must be explicitly marked. Optional inputs must improve quality but not block basic usage.

## 7. Outputs

The product must produce:

- project-brief.md, requirements.md, architecture.md, user-stories.md, api-spec.md, test-plan.md, deployment-plan.md
- a human-readable report or generated package
- machine-readable metadata where useful
- assumptions and unresolved questions
- validation results
- risk warnings
- next-step checklist

Outputs must be exportable or commit-ready for public repository usage.

## 8. Core Capabilities

## 10. Product-Specific Requirements

### 10.1 Required MVP Workflow

A web app where users provide project name, goal, user group, features, tech stack, and deployment target. The system creates a coherent documentation pack that can drive implementation by humans or coding agents.

The MVP must prove this workflow with one complete, documented example.

### 10.2 Product-Specific Features

- Include audit records for run creation, export, and approval.
- Apply least privilege to integrations.

## 15. Privacy Requirements

- Users must know what data is sent to AI providers.
- The product must support safe sample data for public demos.
- Private inputs must not be included in public examples.
- Exported reports must label sensitive sections when applicable.
- Deletion behavior must be documented.

## 16. Observability Requirements

- Every run must have a unique run ID.
- Logs must include step name, status, duration, and failure category.
- AI calls must record provider, model, latency, and token usage when applicable.
- Validation failures must be countable by category.
- Exports must record artifact type and destination.

## 17. Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for input validation.
- Golden-file tests for generated Markdown or JSON artifacts.
- Integration test for the full MVP workflow.
- Error-path tests for missing inputs and failed external calls.
- Security tests for secret redaction.

## 18. Acceptance Criteria

The MVP is ready when:

- a new user can understand SpecStudio from README.md
- docs/brief.md and docs/requirements.md match the product concept
- one sample input can produce one useful sample output
- validation catches missing required inputs
- risks and assumptions are visible
- final output can be exported or committed
- tests cover the happy path and at least three failure paths
- no secrets are committed
- public GitHub repo is coherent and useful
